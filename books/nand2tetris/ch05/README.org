#+TITLE: Chapter 05 Exercises

This directory features implementations for RAM (Memory), processor (CPU) and
the topmost Computer chips for the book.

Also in this directory is a secondary chip called Decoder, which is responsible
for dismantling a certain instruction into named one-bit pins inside the
CPU. For this specific chip, there are test and comparison files (Decoder.tst
and Decoder.cmp).

With this, we now have a full implementation of a simple 16-bit computer of the
Hack architecture.
