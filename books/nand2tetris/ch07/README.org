#+TITLE: Chapter 07 Exercises

This directory is related to the first implementation of the VM Translator.

In here, there is no actual code for the VM Translator, since it is at a
separate repository on GitHub at the time of this writing. Instead, here are
only the generated ~.asm~ files, which were also tested using the test scripts.

The project was called ~cl-hackvmtr~, and is also built in Common Lisp, just like
the assembler. Once the VM Translator is completed, it will also be linked as a
submodule for the next chapter.

Meanwhile, one would be able to check out the [[https://github.com/luksamuk/cl-hackvmtr/tree/v0.5][v0.5 version of the VM Translator]].
