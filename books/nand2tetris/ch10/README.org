#+TITLE: Chapter 10 Exercises

This directory is related to the syntax analysis part of the Jack
Compiler.

There is no actual code for the compiler here. However, there is a
separate repository on GitHub where I am developing it.

The project is called ~cl-jackc~. It is entirely built using Common
Lisp, much like the Assembler and the VM Translator. It is also built
with extra documentation and automated testing sauce, to ensure its
robustness, since it might be the most important piece on the
toolchain.

You can check out the repository for the Compiler [[https://github.com/luksamuk/cl-jackc/tree/v0.5][here]].
