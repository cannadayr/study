// This solves a programming problem described in r/C_Programming.
//
// User inputs a starting value A, step H and the lower limit of function
// value YM. The following conditions have to be true: H > 0.
// The function value y will be calculated in the following points:
// A
// A + H
// A + 2H
// A + 3H
// ...
// while the condition y > YM holds true, however not more than 15 times.
