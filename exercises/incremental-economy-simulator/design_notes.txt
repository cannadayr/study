        == Design notes for Incremental Economy Simulator ==

The whole idea is to make a simulation, where visual effects are the least
possible; the main goal is to actually develop a small, simple game, made
entirely on Common Lisp, despite the SDL2/OpenGL bindings.

Basically, the game style is pretty straightforward; you get resources
and manage them. Getting a certain amount of units will unlock other units,
which will consume resources on build and might consume resources
from time to time.

Personally, I was hoping I could dive into the whole concept of neural networks
to create AI that would interact with the player in a nice way; given that the
player has reached a rank/level and already started developing an army,
it could be fun to let him be attacked by other lesser armies. That could
introduce casualties and stuff, which would require forward planning.

At the same time, I don't want the game to be mentally expensive for the
player, specially because I can get bored with this sort of approach myself!
Never been a fan of RPGs and I don't think that having choices that influence
too deeply on later/other decisions (consider situations where the player NEEDS
to be mindful of this kind of stuff at all times) are something that relax you.
Rather, it makes you tense - at least that's what happens to me.
Sure, you can have decisions that influence stuff later. Sure, you can have
a world that's smart enough to be like that. But you don't need to throw at the
player this kind of stuff to make him worry, nor design it so it will be a
complete path-blocker afterwards. Just let the game do its job.

With that said and done, let's get to it.


Those are the game's general fields (Inventory):
* Max Storage
  Maximum storage for materials.
  Starting value: 1000
* Materials
  Holds all materials you acquire.
* Units
  Holds all units you create.
* Coins
  Currency for the game.
  Not really classified as material, because the amount is unlimited.
* Trades
  List of errands for the game.
  Every errand created is stored on the errands list.
  Each errand may return coins and/or materials, depending on whatever is
  being traded. A percentage will be sold, while another percentage will
  be traded - both randomically -, for every tradeable included on the
  errand.
  Each errand will take some time to complete. That will be calculated
  according to the amount of tradeables included and according to a
  randomic component.


Each unit has the following fields:
* Unit type
  Type of unit. See below.
* Maximum number of units
  This is typically -1, which means infinite.
* Build costs
  Each unit built will consume these materials from the inventory.
* Build requirements
  Each unit built will need these materials to EXIST and maintain themselves,
  however they won't be consumed.
* Build prize
  Each unit built will give you these materials when created.
* Consume cost
  Each unit built will consume these materials every minute to maintain
  themselves.
* Production
  Each unit built will give you these materials every minute.
* Unlockables
  Creating the first unit of this kind will unlock these materials/units.
And the following methods:
