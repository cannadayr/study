#+TITLE: Chapter 06 Exercises

There is practically nothing in here, except for a direct reference to a
separate repository in which the Assembler is being stored and has been written.

My language of choice for making the assembler was Common Lisp, and so I also
managed to redistribute it under the name ~cl-hackasm~.

If you are familiarized with Roswell, you can effectively have the script
~hackasm~ in your PATH and effectively use it as an assembler. It runs pretty well
and is capable of assembling multiple files, too.

For more information, see the project README or visit the [[https://github.com/luksamuk/cl-hackasm][repository]].
