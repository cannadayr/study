#+TITLE: Chapter 07 Exercises

This directory is related to the first implementation of the VM Translator.

In here, there is no actual code for the VM Translator, since it is at a private
repository on GitHub at the time of this writing. Instead, here are only the
generated ~.asm~ files, which were also tested using the test scripts.

The project was called ~cl-hackvmtr~, and is also built in Common Lisp, just like
the assembler. Once the VM Translator is completed, it will also be linked as a
submodule for the next chapter.
