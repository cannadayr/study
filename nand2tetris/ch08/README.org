#+TITLE: Chapter 08 Exercises

This directory contains a submodule for =cl-hackvmtr=, the full VM Translator for
the Hack platform.

The subdirectories =FunctionCalls= and =ProgramFlow= present resulting ASM and OUT
files for the tests provided by the book materials. As ever, these tests are not
included, as they can be obtained from the internet.

Just like ~cl-hackasm~, ~cl-hackvmtr~ offers a Roswell script so you can use it from
command line. For more info, visit [[https://github.com/luksamuk/cl-hackvmtr][the project's repository]].
