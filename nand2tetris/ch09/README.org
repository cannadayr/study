#+TITLE: Chapter 09 Exercises

This chapter is only an exercise to get acquainted with the Jack
language.

This directory contains an implementation for a Minesweeper game,
written in Jack. The implementation is a little "fat", so I suppose it
will not compile with a full Jack OS implementation in under
32K. However, it runs file under the VM Emulator, which should run
just fine.

Compiling the ~hackmines~ directory should provide all necessary ~.vm~
files to run the game. One can just open the ~hackmines~ directory using
the VM Emulator to play the game.
